**Rules**

The goal of the game is to get a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10 points.
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value would be more beneficial for the player.
The dealer deals two cards to the player and two cards to themselves. The player's cards are both face up, while one of the dealer's cards is face up and the other is face down.
The player can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
If the player's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and automatically lose the game.
Once the player has finished their turn, the dealer reveals their face down card and draws additional cards until their hand value is 17 or more.
If the dealer's hand goes over 21, they bust and the player automatically wins.
If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the winner is the one with the highest hand value.
